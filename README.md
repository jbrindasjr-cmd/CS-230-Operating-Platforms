# CS 230 Module Eight Journal Reflection

## Client Summary and Software Requirements
The client for this course was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application. The goal was to allow multiple users to play simultaneously across different platforms while ensuring that each game instance and team name remained unique. The software needed to be scalable, secure, and compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The design focused on creating a distributed application that could support future growth and multiple concurrent users.

## Strengths in Developing the Design Document
One area I performed particularly well in was clearly outlining the system architecture and explaining how different components of the application interact with one another. I was able to effectively document the use of object-oriented principles, such as encapsulation and modular design, which helped create a structured and maintainable solution. I also did a strong job analyzing platform requirements and comparing operating systems to justify the recommended deployment environment.

## Helpful Aspects of the Design Process
Working through the software design document before coding was extremely helpful. It allowed me to think through potential challenges, such as concurrency control and scalability, before implementation. Having a clear design plan made the coding process more efficient and reduced the likelihood of major changes later. The UML diagrams and architectural descriptions helped clarify how classes and services should interact, which improved overall code organization.

## Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the security section of the design document. While security considerations were addressed, I would expand this section to include more detailed explanations of authentication, authorization, and data protection strategies. Adding more concrete examples of how security risks are mitigated would strengthen the overall design.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on usability, scalability, and reliability. The requirement for unique game and team names directly influenced the use of a centralized game service to manage instances. Considering the user’s needs is critical in software design because it ensures the final product is functional, intuitive, and aligned with client expectations.

## Software Design Approach and Future Strategies
My approach to designing software involved breaking the system into smaller components and analyzing each requirement individually before combining them into a complete solution. In the future, I would continue using techniques such as requirements analysis, UML modeling, and iterative design reviews. I would also place more emphasis on user stories and feedback early in the process to ensure the software remains aligned with client goals throughout development.
